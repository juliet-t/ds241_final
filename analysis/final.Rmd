title: "How the flow of traffic of cars correlates with bike share data"
output: html_notebook
---

- Look for areas that people do not use cars as much in 
- Put more bikes in the areas where there are less people commuting to work in cars
- Relation between motorized vehicles and bikes
- Parking spaces
- Last mile
- Where best to place bike stations 
-
